				<h1>Portfolio website</h1>
				<p class="date">ONGOING</p>
				<p class="content">My portfolio website is this site you're on right now - its purpose is to showcase my personal projects.
				It's hosted on GitHub pages - this means I can't use a database to store information. To circumvent this, I'm currently working on a script, that would load articles from an xml file.</p>

				<h1>IMGCRY</h1>
				<p class="date">2020</p>
				<p class="content">After reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> - the practice of concealing a message within another message - I knew I had to try it myself. This program can hide a text by splitting and storing it as the least significant bit of an images' pixel colour value.
				The chages are very miniscule and usually it's impossible to tell the old and new picture apart.</p>
